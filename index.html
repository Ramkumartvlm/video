        <p id="para1">Once upon a time, in the night sky, there was a little star named Stella. Stella was the smallest star, but she had the biggest dreams. Every night, she looked down at Earth and wished she could help make someone's wish come true.

            One night, Stella saw children making wishes on shooting stars. She felt a bit sad and whispered, "I wish I could make someone's wish come true."
            
            A warm breeze blew by, and a wise old star's voice said, "Little Stella, your wish is heard. Be patient. Even a tiny star can make a big difference."
            
            With new hope, Stella decided to find a way to make a wish come true. She saw a comet passing by and asked, "Hello, Comet. Can you help me make a wish come true?"
            
            Comet's tail sparkled as it smiled. "Follow the trail of stardust, and you'll find what you're looking for."
            
            Stella followed the stardust trail to a magical place at the edge of the sky. There, she met the Dream Weaver, a wise star who made dreams into pictures in the sky.
            
            "Dear Dream Weaver," Stella said, "I want to make someone's wish come true. Can you help me?"
            
            The Dream Weaver nodded. "To make a wish come true, you must go to Earth and find the essence of dreams. Be brave and kind."
            
            With a bright twinkle, Stella went down to Earth as a streak of light. She landed in a meadow where children played. She saw a little girl named Mia looking up at the stars.
            
            "What's your wish, Mia?" Stella whispered.
            
            Mia looked up and said, "I wish I could find my lost toy bunny."
            
            Stella's heart warmed. She knew she had found the wish to grant. She turned into a sparkling trail, leading Mia to her toy bunny.
            
            Mia followed the trail through moonlit forests and across sparkling streams. She found her bunny under a silver birch tree.
            
            "Thank you, little star," Mia whispered, holding her bunny close.
            
            Stella twinkled with joy, knowing she had made Mia's wish come true. She went back to the night sky, her light shining even brighter. Mia looked up and whispered, "Thank you, little star."
            
            Stella glowed with happiness. She knew that even a small star could make a big difference.
            
            And so, every night, Stella shone brightly, granting wishes and lighting up the sky with her kind and radiant heart.
            
            The end.</p>
